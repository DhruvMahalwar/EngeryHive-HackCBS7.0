## Overview
India’s power sector is losing billions due to traditional  grid networks and power generation from non renewable resources(coal) . But what if individuals could trade energy with each other that too clean energy making them prosumers instead of consumers ?

EnergyHive—a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that lets small producers sell surplus renewable energy securely and at fair, market-driven prices. More than just an energy exchange, EnergyHive empowers communities and fuels a sustainable future. Let’s dive in and see how we’re revolutionizing energy one watt at a time!

## Issues in the Power Sector

1. **Dependency on Coal**  
   The majority of electricity production relies on coal, leading to higher costs, environmental degradation, and increased carbon emissions.

2. **Financial Losses in Distribution Companies (Discoms)**  
   Discoms reported losses of ₹68,832 crore in 2022-23, a fourfold increase from the previous year, largely due to coal import costs, processing expenses, grid maintenance, and electricity theft.

3. **Centralized Power Model Limitations**  
   Small energy producers, like those using solar, struggle to sell surplus energy directly. Due to limited access and a centralized structure, they often receive inadequate compensation for their contributions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More
